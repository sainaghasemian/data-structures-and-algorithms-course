# Data Structures and Algorithms
Implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms from my Data Structures and Algorithms course CPSC 319.

### Implementations
**Data Structures:**
- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Binary Search Trees, Heaps
- Hash Tables with collision handling

**Algorithms:**
- Sorting: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort
- Searching: Binary Search, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm
